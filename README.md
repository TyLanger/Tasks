# Tasks

Play a multiplayer game as normal (everyone needs the mod) and you'll get some tasks to complete each stage. You're competing vs the other players to be the first to complete a task.

The tasks aren't especially difficult to do. The goal is to race your friends to be the first to complete them.

The mod technically works in singleplayer, but most of the tasks are only active in multiplayer so you'll have a much smaller pool.

## Task Examples

AirKills - Jump, then get x kills before you touch the ground.

MostDistance - Travel the farthest. Evaluated when you charge the TP and use it to go to the next stage.

OpenChests - Be the first to open x chests (multishops count too).

Die - It's a race to 0hp.

VeryBest - Be the very best. Like no one ever was. (kill the most unique enemies. beetle and fire beetle are different.)

There are 20+ tasks to do. The description mostly tells you what to do. Some of the descriptions are a bit vague so you'll have to figure out what to do.

## Rewards

Completing a task rewards you the item shown in the UI. 

If the UI says you will get 5 of an item, they are temp items. You'll lose 3 of them at the end of the stage and lose 2 more at the end of next stage.

If the UI has a picture of the command artifact, you'll get a command droplet of that item's colour. 

## Installation:

Requires BepInEx, R2API, HookGenPatcher, and MiniRpcLib

Place Tasks.dll in Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins

## Changelog:

1.0.0 - the mod probably works. The UI is bad and there are probably bugs.
